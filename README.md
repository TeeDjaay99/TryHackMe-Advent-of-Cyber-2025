# 🎄 TryHackMe – Advent of Cyber 2025 🎄

## Daily Hands-On Cybersecurity Practice & Documentation
Welcome to my Advent of Cyber 2025 repository.
This project documents my daily cybersecurity learning, hands-on challenges, and practical skills developed through TryHackMe’s annual Advent of Cyber event.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

**This repo is my personal way of tracking what I learn each day, practicing new tools, and improving my understanding of cybersecurity concepts.**

* This is not just a challenge log — it’s a portfolio piece demonstrating:

* My ability to learn cybersecurity concepts rapidly

* Hands-on experience with real tools

* Documentation and communication skills

* Consistency and discipline

* A realistic simulation of SOC analyst workflows

Each day includes:

✔ Explanation of the task

✔ Tools used

✔ Key takeaways

✔ Cybersecurity concepts

✔ Step-by-step summaries

✔ Screenshots of the process (never the answer/flag)

## 👋 About Me

I’m studying Cloud Development (Java & AWS), but I’ve realized I enjoy working with cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity much more than writing code. I’m focusing on building skills in cloud engineering, security, and hands-on problem solving — areas I find both more engaging and more aligned with my future goals.

This repository helps me stay consistent, structured, and focused while building practical skills.
